# Case Study
A fictional company wants to identify its high-value customers in order to tailor
# Data Source
The data was gotten from Maven Analytics Data Playground.[Link](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?search=customer%20churn)
# Tools
### Python
Libraries and packages used:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scipy
- Scikit-learn
# Method of Analysis
I conducted a customer segmentation based on value using the K-means clustering approach and applied an analytic pipeline which involved five stages:
- Importing the necessary libraries and packages and loading the dataset
- Data preprocessing which involved data cleaning and transformation
- Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
- Data clustering using K-means algorithm
- Clustering analysis and visualization
# Exploratory Data Analysis
After data cleaning and data transformation, I performed statistical analysis using the Pearson correlation coefficient method to detect if there were any relationships, associations or patterns present between variables in the dataset.

describing the key patterns, trends, and anomalies discovered by examining your data through visual representations and summary statistics, essentially providing an overview of what the data reveals without making strong conclusions, but highlighting areas of interest for further investigation.  This involves investigating interactions between two or more variables through visualizations and statistical 
# Hypothesis
Here are my assumptions based on the findings of the EDA conducted:
- Customers that have stayed longer with the company yield more revenue
- These customers also provide more value as they bring more referrals
