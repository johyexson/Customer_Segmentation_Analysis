# Case Study
Customer segmentation in order to classify customer based on demographics, purchasing behaviour and other characteristics. Utilized K-means algorithm to segment telecommunication customers based on their value and profitability, in order to facilitate strategic planning and effective decision making
# Data Source
The data was gotten from Maven Analytics Data Playground.[Link](https://mavenanalytics.io/data-playground?search=customer%20churn)
# Tools
- Python
Libraries and packages used:
- Pandas
- Numpy
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Scikit-learn
# Method of Analysis
I conducted a customer segmentation based on value using the K-means clustering approach and applied an analytic pipeline which involved five stages:
- Importing the necessary libraries and packages and loading the dataset
- Data preprocessing which involved data cleaning and transformation
- Exploratory Data Analysis(EDA)
- Data clustering using K-means algorithm
- Data Visualization
# Exploratory Data Analysis
This process started with data cleaning and transformation, then I performed statistical analysis using the Pearson correlation method to analyse relationships between variables in the dataset.
# Code
